## Chapter 8: Data visualisation with ggplot2

Visualisation is a powerful tool that allows us to explore our data,
generate hypotheses and choose appropriate analysis methods. It is
important to understand where the data is from, what it looks like and
to formulate a clear research question before performing any analyses.
When choosing which quantitative methods are the most appropriate to
address the research question, visualisations also allow us to check
parametric assumptions that must be met for certain methods to ensure
they are valid. Finally, visualisation can be used to convey results and
important messages to an audience in a more concise and often more
interesting way than written within the text.
