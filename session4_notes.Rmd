## Chapter 8: Data visualisation with ggplot2

Visualisation is a powerful tool that allows us to explore our data, generate hypotheses and choose appropriate analysis methods. It is important to understand where the data is from, what it looks like and to formulate a clear research question before performing any analyses. When choosing which quantitative methods are the most appropriate to address the research question, visualisations also allow us to check parametric assumptions that must be met for certain methods to ensure they are valid. Finally, visualisation can be used to convey results and important messages to an audience in a more concise and often more interesting way than written within the text. 

### 8.1 Choosing the most appropriate visualisation

The most appropriate choice of visualisation will depend on the type of variable(s) we wish to display, the number of variables and the message we are trying to disseminate. Common plots used to display combinations of different types of data are given in following table: 


```{r Visualisation table, echo = FALSE}
vis_tab <- data.frame(n_vars = c(rep("One variable", 5), rep("Two variables", 5),
                                 rep("> 2 variables", 2)),
                      type_vars = c(rep("Categorical", 2), "Numerical", "Spatial",
                                    "Temporal", rep("Two categorical", 2), 
                                    rep("One numeric, one categorical", 2), 
                                    "Two numerical", "> 2 categorical", 
                                    "2 numeric, one categorical or > 2 numeric"),
                      visualisation = c("Frequency table", "Bar chart", "Histogram",
                                        "Map", "Line plot", "Frequency table", 
                                        "Stacked/side-by-side bar chart", "Dot plot",
                                        "Box plot", "Scatterplot", "Table", 
                                        "Scatterplot with different colours/symbols/sizes"),
                      geom_obj = c("table", "geom_bar", "geom_histogram", "geom_sf",
                                   "geom_line", "table", "geom_bar", "geom_point",
                                   "geom_boxplot", "geom_point", "table", "geom_point"))

flextable(vis_tab) %>% 
  set_header_labels(n_vars = "Number of variables", 
                    type_vars = "Type of variables", 
                    visualisation = "Visualisation",
                    geom_obj = "geom object (or R function)") %>% 
  merge_at(i = 1:5, j = 1) %>% 
  merge_at(i = 6:10, j = 1) %>% 
  merge_at(i = 11:12, j = 1) %>% 
  merge_at(i = 1:2, j = 2) %>% 
  merge_at(i = 6:7, j = 2) %>% 
  merge_at(i = 8:9, j = 2) %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  vline(part = "all", j = 1:3) %>% 
  hline(part = "body", i = c(5, 10, 12)) %>%
  hline(i = c(2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11), j = 2:4) %>% 
  hline(i = c(1, 6, 8), j = 3:4) %>% 
  bold(part = "header") %>% 
  bg(part = "body", bg = "gray95") %>% 
  set_caption("Table 1: Common visualisations by number and type of variables, with R function")
```

R is very flexible when it comes to visualising data and contains a wide variety of options to edit graphs. This section will focus on the Tidyverse package ```ggplot2``` and introduce some of the more commonly used graphical functions and parameters but is by no means comprehensive. The package implements the ‘grammar of graphics’, a system that aims to describe all statistical graphics in terms of their components or layers. All graphics can be broken down into the same components: the data, a coordinate system (or plot area) and some visual markings of the data. More complex plots may have additional layers but all must contain these three. 

For example, in the ```csp_2020``` dataset, we may wish to explore the relationship between the settlement funding assessment (SFA) and council tax total (ct_total) spending for each local authority. To visualise the relationship between two continuous numeric variables, a scatterplot would be most appropriate. Within the ```ggplot2``` package, we first use the function ```ggplot( )``` to create a coordinate system (a blank plot space) that we can add layers and objects to. Within this function, we specify the data that we wish to display on the coordinate system:

```{r ggplot initiallisation, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = csp_2020)
```

If we just ran this code, it would create an empty graph. To add information to the graph, we add a **geom** layer: a visual representation of the data. There are many different geom objects built into the ggplot2 package (begin typing ```?geom``` into the console to see a list), the ```geom_point()``` function is used to create scatterplots. Each geom object must contain a mapping argument, coupled with the ```aes``` function which defines how the variables in the dataset are visualised. In this case, we use the function to specify the variables on the x and y axes but it can also be used to set the colour, size or symbol based on variable values. 

```{r Scatterplot SFA and CT total 2020}
ggplot(data = csp_2020) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = sfa_2020, y = ct_total_2020))
```

The scatterplot shows a positive association between the SFA and council tax spending in English local authorities during 2020. We can also identify an outlier in the top right corner of the graph. Before proceding, we want to ensure that this observation is an outlier and not an error to be removed from the data. We can use the ```filter``` function to return the name of the local authority that matches these values:

```{r Find outlier}
filter(csp_2020, sfa_2020 > 1000) %>% 
  select(authority)
```

This outlier is the Greater London Authority which is a combination of local authorities that are already included in the dataset separately. Including this observation would introduce duplicates into the analysis so this should be removed to avoid invalid results. To remove the Greater London Authority observation, we can combine the ```filter``` and ```ggplot``` functions using pipes:

```{r Scatter without London}
csp_2020 %>% 
  filter(authority != "Greater London Authority") %>% 
  ggplot( ) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = sfa_2020, y = ct_total_2020))
```

Graphs appear in the plot window in RStudio and can be opened in a new window using the ![](images/zoom_shortcut.png) icon. Graphs in this window can also be copied and pasted into other documents using the ![](images/export_shortcut.png) icon and selecting *Copy to clipboard*. 

New graphs will replace existing ones in this window but all graphs created in the current session of R can be explored using the ![](images/arrow_shortcut.png) icons. Graphs can be stored as objects using the ```<-``` symbol. These objects can then be saved as picture or PDF files using the ```ggsave``` function:

```{r ggsave, eval = FALSE}
sfa_ct_plot <- csp_2020 %>% 
  filter(authority != "Greater London Authority") %>% 
  ggplot( ) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = sfa_2020, y = ct_total_2020, colour = region))

ggsave(sfa_ct_plot, filename = "sfa_ct_plot.png")
```

## Exercise 5
1.	Create a new data object containing the 2020 CSP data without the Greater London Authority observation. Name this data frame ```csp_nolon_2020```.
2.	Using the ```csp_nolon_2020``` data, create a data visualisation to check the distribution (or shape) of the SFA variable.
3.	Based on the visualisation above, create a summary table for the SFA variable containing the minimum and maximum, and appropriate measures of the centre/average and spread.

```{r Save csp_nolon object for future code, include = FALSE}
csp_nolon_2020 <- csp_2020 %>% 
  filter(authority != "Greater London Authority")
```


### 8.2 Customising visualisations
Additional variables can be included into a visualisation within the mapping argument of a ```geom``` function. For example, we could explore the relationship between SFA and council tax across regions by colouring points based on the region:

```{r Scatterplot, SFA and council tax by region}
ggplot(data = csp_nolon_2020) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = sfa_2020, y = ct_total_2020, colour = region))

```

By default, R uses alphabetical ordering for character variables. To change this order, the variable must be converted into a **factor**. A factor is how R recognises categorical variables. For example, to order the region legend so that the London region appears first, followed by other regions from north to south, we would use the ```mutate``` function, combined with the ```factor``` function to create a new, ordered variable. the argument ```levels``` allows us to specify the order of categories in a factor:

```{r Factor region}
csp_nolon_2020_new <- csp_nolon_2020 %>% 
  mutate(region_fct = factor(region, levels = c("L" , "NW", "NE", "YH", "WM", "EM",
                                                "EE", "SW", "SE")))

ggplot(data = csp_nolon_2020_new) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = sfa_2020, y = ct_total_2020, colour = region_fct))
```

Other aesthetic mapping options that can be used to visualise other variable(s) within the same plot include ```shape```, which changes the symbol based on a category, ```size```, which sets the size of each point to the numerical value of a variable, and ```alpha```, which sets the transparency of each point based on a numerical value. These can be combined to visualise more than three variables in the same graph but this should only be used when this is not complicating the message. 

Aesthetic properties of the geom object may also be set manually, outside of the ```aes``` function, using the same options but with a value rather than a variable. For example:

```{r Manually setting aesthetics}
ggplot(csp_nolon_2020) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = sfa_2020, y = ct_total_2020), colour = "blue")
```

## Exercise 6
1. What is the problem with the following code? Fix the code to change the shape of all the points.

```{r aesthetic exercise, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(csp_nolon_2020) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = sfa_2020, y = ct_total_2020, shape = "*"))
```

2. Add a line of best fit to the scatterplot showing the relationship between SFA and council tax total (hint: use ```?geom_smooth```).

3.	Add a line of best fit for each region (hint: make each line a different colour).

### 8.3 Scale functions
Scale functions allow us to customise aesthetics defined in geom objects such as colours and axes labels. They take the form ```scale_`aesthetic to customise’_`scale of variable’```. For example, ```scale_x_continuous``` customises the x axis when the variable is continuous, ```scale_x_discrete``` can be used where the variable is discrete or categorical. Arguments to customise the x or y axes include:

- ```name = ``` to change the acis title
- ```limits = c(...)``` sets the axis limits
- ```breaks = c(...)``` defines tick marks
- ```labels = c(...)``` attaches labels to break values
- ```trans = ``` transforms the scale that the axis is shown on. 

```{r scale_x and scale_y}
ggplot(csp_nolon_2020) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = sfa_2020, y = ct_total_2020, colour = region)) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Settlement funding assessment (£ millions)", 
                     limits = c(0, 600), 
                     breaks = c(0, 200, 400, 600)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Council tax (£ millions)", trans = "sqrt")
```

A common transformation that can be useful to explore the relationship between variables which have clusters of smaller values is the logarithm (or log) function. Applying a log function to a scale increases the difference between smaller values (stretching out these clusters), while reducing the difference between the smaller values and largest ones. Log functions can only be applied to positive, non-zero numbers. Where a sample may contain zeroes, the transformation ```log1p``` can be applied instead which adds 1 to each value before applying the log transformation ($log(n + 1)$):

```{r log1p transformation }
ggplot(csp_nolon_2020) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = sfa_2020, y = ct_total_2020, colour = region)) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "SFA", limits = c(0, 600), 
                     breaks = c(0, 200, 400, 600),
                     trans = "log1p") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Council tax", trans = "log1p") 
```

We can now clearly see the strong positive association between SFA and council tax spending in local authorities with lower values of this without losing any information. 

There are a wide range of options for customising the colour aesthetics of geoms, these include pre-defined colour palettes, such as ```scale_colour_viridis_c``` for continuous variables, or ```scale_colour_viridis_d``` for discrete or categorical variables. Viridis colour palettes are designed to be colourblind friendly and print well in grey scale. there are also many R packages containing colour palettes for different scenarios. 

Colour palettes can be created manually for categorical variables using the ```scale_colour_manual``` function. Here, the argument ```values``` allows us to specify a colour per category, wither by listing them within the function, or entering a vector object that can be repeated across multiple plots:

```{r region colour palette}
region_palette <- c("aquamarine2", "blue", "chartreuse2", "coral", "orchid", "firebrick",
                    "gold3", "violetred", "grey50")

ggplot(csp_nolon_2020_new) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = sfa_2020, y = ct_total_2020, colour = region_fct)) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "SFA",  trans = "log1p") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Council tax", trans = "log1p") +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "Region", values = region_palette)
```

R contains a list of 657 pre-programmed colours that can be used to create palettes (use the function ```colours()``` for a full list). Hexadecimal codes can also be included instead in the form ```#rrggbb``` (where rr (red), gg (green), and bb (blue) are numbers between 00 and 99 giving the level of intensity of each colour). A useful website for generating palettes with hexadecimal codes is <https://coolors.co/>.

Palettes can also be created using gradients with the ```scale_colour_gradient``` function, that specifies a two colour gradient from low to high, ```scale_colour_gradient2``` that creates a diverging gradient using low, medium, and high colours, and ```scale_colour_gradientn``` that creates an n-colour gradient.

### 8.4 Other labelling functions

Although axis and legend labels can be updated within scale functions, the ```labs` function exist as an alternative. This function also allows us to add titles and subtitles to visualisations:

```{r labs function, eval = FALSE}
labs(x = “x-axis name”, y = “y-axis name”,
	colour = “Grouping variable name”, title = “Main title”,
	subtitle = “Subtitle”, caption = “Footnote”)
```

The ```annotate``` function allows us to add text and other objects to a ggplot object. For example:

```{r annotate, eval = FALSE}
annotate(“text”, x = 50, y = 200, label = “Text label here”)
```

Adds “Text label here” to a plot at the coordinates (50, 200) on a graph, and

```{r annotate to add rectangle, eval = FALSE}
annotate(“rect”, xmin = 0, xmax = 10, ymin = 20, ymax = 50, alpha = 0.2)
```

### 8.5 Theme functions

The ```theme``` function modifies non-data components of the visualisation. For example, the legend position, label fonts, the graph background, and gridlines. There are many options that exist within the ```theme``` function (use ```?theme``` to list them all). One of the most common is ```legend.position``` which can be used to move the legend to the top or bottom of the graph space (```legend.position = “top”``` or ```legend.position = “bottom”```) or remove the legend completely (```legend.position = “none”```). 

ggplot also contains a number of ‘complete themes’ which change all non-data elements of the plot to a programmed default. For example ```theme_void()``` removes all gridlines and axes, ```theme_light()``` changes the graph background white and the gridlines and axes light grey:

```{r theme void}
ggplot(csp_nolon_2020_new) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = sfa_2020, y = ct_total_2020, colour = region_fct)) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "SFA",  trans = "log1p") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Council tax", trans = "log1p") +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "Region", values = region_palette) + 
  theme_void( )
```

One benefit of using themes is that all visualisations will be consistent in terms of colour scheme, font size and gridlines. Although there are pre-built themes, we are able to create our own and save them as functions. These can then be used in place of R’s themes. For example:

```{r Create a theme}
theme_intro_course <- function( ) {
  theme(legend.position =  "bottom", 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 15),
        title = element_text(size = 20),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", colour = "grey50"))
}
```

The function ```theme_intro_course``` can be added to the end of any visualisation and will move the legend to the bottom of the graph, change the axis text to size 10, the axis titles to size 15, the plot title to size 20, and the graph background to white with a grey outline:

```{r Add custom theme}
ggplot(csp_nolon_2020_new) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = sfa_2020, y = ct_total_2020, colour = region_fct)) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "SFA",  trans = "log1p") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Council tax", trans = "log1p") +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "Region", values = region_palette) + 
  theme_intro_course( )
```

Creating a custom theme is useful to ensure all visualisations are formatted consistently. 

### 8.6 Facet functions

Faceting allows us to divide a plot into subplots based on some grouping variable within the data. This allows us to show multiple variables in the same visualisation without risking overloading the plot and losing the intended message. 

For example, if we wish to show the relationship between SFA, council tax total and regions over the entire time period, we may wish to create a scatterplot per year. Faceting allows us to do this in one piece of code rather than repeating it per year. Faceting will also ensure that plots are on the same scale and therefore easier to compare. The function ```facet_wrap``` creates these facetted plots:

```{r Facet by region}
csp_long2 %>% 
  filter(authority != "Greater London Authority") %>% 
  ggplot( ) +
  geom_point(aes(x = sfa, y = ct_total, colour = region)) +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "Region", values = region_palette) + 
  labs(x = "Settlement funding assessment (£ millions)", 
       y = "Council tax total (£ millions)", colour = "Region") +
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  theme_light()
```

## Exercise 7

Use an appropriate data visualisation to show how the total spend in each local authority has changed over the years between 2015 and 2020. Choose a visualisation that shows these trends over time and allows us to compare them between regions.
