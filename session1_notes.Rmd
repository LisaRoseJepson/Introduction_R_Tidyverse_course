## Chapter 1: Introduction to RStudio

There are a number of software packages based on the R programming language aimed at making writing and running analyses easier for users. They all run R in the background but look different and contain different features. RStudio has been chosen for this course as it allows users to create script files, allowing code to be re-run, edited, and shared easily; RStudio also provides tools to help easily identify errors in R code, integrates help documentation into the main console and uses colour-coding to help read code at a glance. 

RStudio is free to download for Windows, Mac or Linux from the following website:

<https://posit.co/>

The basic R software must be installed before Rstudio can be used, this can be downloaded from:

<https://cran.r-project.org/>

### 1.1 RStudio console window
The screenshot below shows the RStudio interface which comprises of four windows: the R script file (A), the console (B), environment and history (C), and files, packages and help (D).

**Window A: R script files**

All analysis and actions in R are carried out using the R syntax language. R script files allow you to write and edit code before running it in the console window. If this window is not visible, create a new script file using *File -> New File -> R Script* from the drop-down menus or clicking the ![](images/new_file_shortcut.png) symbol above the console and selecting *R Script*. This will open a new, blank script file. More than one script file can be open at the same time.

Code entered into the script file does not run automatically. To run commands from the script, highlight the code and click ![](images/run_shortcut.png) (this can be carried out by pressing *Ctrl + Enter* in Windows or *Cmnd + Enter* on a Mac computer). More than one command can be run at the same time by highlighting all of them.

The main advantage of using the script file rather than entering the code directly into the console is that it can be saved, edited and shared for future reference. To save a script file, select *File -> Save As…* from the drop down menu or use the ![](images/save.png) icon at the top of the window. It is important to save the script files at regular intervals to avoid losing work. Past script files can be opened using *File -> Open File…* from the drop-down menu or by clicking the ![](images/open_shortcut.png) icon and selecting a .R file. 


**Window B: The R console**

This is where all commands run from the script file, results other than graphics, and error messages are displayed. Commands can be written directly into the R console after the ```>``` symbol and executed using the Enter key. It is not recommended to write code directly into the console as it is cannot be saved and replicated.

To clear the text from the console, leaving a blank white screen, press *Ctrl + L* for Windows and *Cmnd + L* on Mac computers. This command will only clear the text and will not remove any saved objects.


**Window C: Environment and history**

This window lists all data and objects currently loaded into R. More details on the types of objects and how to use the Environment window are given in later sections.


**Window D: Files, plots, packages and help**

This window has many potential uses: graphics are displayed and can be saved from here, and R help files will appear here. This window is only available in the RStudio interface and not in the basic R package.

**Exercise 1**

1.	Open a new script file if you have not already done so.

2.	Save this script file into an appropriate location using Save as... from the drop-down menu


## Chapter 2: Introduction to R programming

All analyses within R is carried out using *syntax*, the R programming language. It is important to note that R is case-sensitive so always ensure that you use the correct combination of upper and lower case letters when running functions or calling objects. Any text written in the R console or script file can be treated the same as text from other documents or programmes: text can be highlighted, copied and pasted as in Word documents to make coding more efficient. When creating script files, it is important to ensure they are clear and easy to read. Comments can be added to script files using the ```#``` symbol. R will ignore any text following this symbol on the same line. 

The choice of brackets in R coding is particularly important as they all have different functions. Round brackets ```( )``` are the most commonly used as they define arguments of functions. Any text followed by round brackets is assumed to be a function and R will attempt to run it. Square brackets ```[ ]``` are used to set criteria or conditions within a function or object. Curly brackets ```{ }``` are used within loops, when creating a new function, and within ```for``` and ```if``` functions. If the name of a function is not followed by round brackets, R will return the algorithm for the function within the console. 

All standard notation for mathematical calculations (```+, -, *, /, ^```, etc.) are compatible with R. At its simplest level, R is a powerful calculator.

**Exercise 2**

1. Add your name and the date to the top of your script file (hint: comment this out so R does not try to run it)

2. Use R to answer to following and write the answers within the script file:
  - $64^2$
  - $12687 - 85221$
  - $3432 \div 8$
  - $96 \times 72$
  

## Chapter 3: R objects and functions

One of the main advantages to using R over other software packages such as SPSS is that more than one dataset can be accessed at the same time. A collection of data stored in any format within R is known as an **object**. Objects can be single numbers, single variables, entire datasets or lists of datasets.


Objects are defined in R using the ```<-``` symbol (the ‘less than’ symbol followed by a dash. Note that there is no space between these as this changes the meaning of the symbol to ‘less than, minus’) or ```=```. For example, by typing ```obj1 <- 81``` or ```obj1 = 81```, an object called ```obj1``` is defined with the value 81 and will appear in the environment window of the console. Throughout this booklet, the symbol ```<-``` will be used to avoid confusion between the definition of an object and the mathematical meaning of ```=```.

To retrieve a saved object, type its name into the script or console and run it. For example, if we type ```obj1``` into the console, 81 will appear. This object can then be called in functions and calculations.

```{r defining objects}
obj1 <- 81

obj1

obj1 * 2
```
  
R has some mathematical objects stored by default such as pi that can be used in calculations.

```{r pi}
pi
```

The ```[1]``` that appears at the beginning of each output line indicates that this is the first element in the object. If there were two lines then the second line would start with the number of that element in square brackets. For example, if we had an object with 6 elements and when called the first line contained the first 5 elements, each line would begin with ```[1]``` and ```[6]``` respectively.

**Functions** are built-in commands that allow R users to run analyses. All functions require the definition of arguments within round brackets. For example, if we wanted to find out the square root or an object, we could use the built-in ```sqrt``` function or if we wanted to find the median of a group of numbers, we could use the built-in ```median``` function. 

To remove objects from the RStudio environment, use the ```rm(objectname)``` function. To remove every object from the environment, use the command ```rm(list = ls())```. **IMPORTANT NOTE**: be cautious when using these commands as they permanently delete objects and cannot be undone. The only way to reverse this is to re-run the code that originally created the objects. 


## Chapter 4: Help and error messages

Each function that exists within R has an associated help file. To retrieve these help files, enter ```?``` followed by the function name into the console window, e.g ```?mean```. The help file will appear in RStudio containing the following sections:

-	Description: what the function is used for
-	Usage: how the function is used
-	Arguments: required and optional arguments entered into round brackets necessary for the function to work
-	Details: relevant details about the function in question
-	References
-	See also: links to other relevant functions
-	Examples: example code with applications of the function
 
An internet connection is not required to access this documentation within RStudio but these help pages are also available on the R website. 

If a function is not defined correctly or there is some mistake in syntax that has been run in the console, R is usually good at identifying errors and providing informative error messages that include the location of the error. 
For example: 

```{r error messages objects, error = TRUE}
plot(x, y)

```

The objects ```x``` and ```y``` have not been defined within R and so the command cannot run. 

```{r error messages function, error = TRUE}
Sqrt(obj1)
```

R is case sensitive so cannot find the function ```Sqrt```.


```obj1 +```

When working within the R console, if a command is run before it is finished or if all brackets are not closed, a ```+``` symbol will appear on the next line rather than ```>```. This means that R expects you to keep writing. To overcome this issue, either finish the command on the next line or press the *esc* button on your keyboard to start from scratch.

One of the benefits of using RStudio rather than the basic R package is that it will suggest object or function names after typing the first few letters. This avoids spelling mistakes and accidental errors when running code. To accept the suggestion, either click the correct choice with your mouse or use the *tab* button on your keyboard.
